## House Election Model
### Finley Costello

This is a machine-learning model with the goal of correctly predicting which party will win elections to the house of representatives. Given the erratic nature of polling in the Trump era, the model only uses data on the "fundamentals" of each house district: demographic data, partisanship, and political context (Whether the election is a midterm, the party of the president, etc.)
